#Question 3 - Max Num

#Here is a more traditional coding problem for you.
#This function will be used to find the maximum number in a list of numbers.
#This can be accomplished using the max() function in python, but as a challenge, we are going to manually implement this function.
# Here is what we need to do:

  #1. Define the function to accept a list of numbers called nums
  #2. Set our default maximum value to be the first element in the list
  #3. Loop through every number in the list of numbers
  #4. Within the loop, if we find a number greater than our starting maximum, then replace the maximum with what we found.
  #5. Return the maximum number


#Coding Question

#Create a function named max_num() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.
#The function should return the largest number in nums

#My work

def max_nums(nums):

  max = nums[0] #let 1st elem be the MAX as the start

  for elem in nums: #loop - for checking ALL elem in the list
    if elem > max:
      max = elem #replace the value of maximum if it meets the condition
  return max
