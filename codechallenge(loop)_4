#Question 4 - Same Values

#In this challenge, we need to find the indices in two equally sized lists where the numbers match.
#We will be iterating through both of them at the same time and comparing the values, if the numbers are equal, then we record the index. 
#These are the steps we need to accomplish this:


  #1. Define our function to accept two lists of numbers
  #2. Create a new list to store our matching indices
  #3. Loop through each index to the end of either of our lists
  #4. Within the loop, check if our first list at the current index is equal to the second list at the current index. If so, append the index where they matched
  #5. Return the maximum number


#Coding Question

#Write a function named same_values() that takes two lists of numbers of equal size as parameters.
#The function should return a list of the INDICES where the values were equal in lst1 and lst2.
#For example, the following code should return [0, 2, 3]


#My work

def same_values(lst1, lst2):

  com_idx = [] #List of INDECES, not the VALUES

  for i in range(len(lst1)): #looping with the INDEX <- 'i' becomes the index - **MUST use range() & len() of the list we use as input
    if lst1[i] == lst2[i]:
      com_idx.append(i) #i = the INDEX
  return com_idx


#Important note
  #To loop with INDEX - follow the format of:
    #for i in range(len(list))
    #where i = index, the 'pointer' towards the list
    #where list, is the list, as input
